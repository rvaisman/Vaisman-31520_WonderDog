    MessageText: I would recommend you to leave Kingdom of Bicho Land, but if you
      still want to reach de Royal City you may access the castle using an already
      open portal in the mine that leads to the Catle yards. In the Castle, look
      for the White Duke, he will be able to open a portal to the city outskirts.
      Good Luck!
